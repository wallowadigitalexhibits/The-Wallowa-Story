              The Library of Congress says of this image, “Caption identifies sitters as Eagle of Light, Nez Perce; Joseph, Nez Perce; and (Smohollah). However, Bill Gulick in Chief Joseph Country: Land of the Nez Perce, 1981, identifies sitters in this image as Billy Carter, Ollokot (Chief Joseph's brother) and Middle Bear.” Further, the photo in slide 023 has cut out a close-section of the middle man and labeled him as Ollokot as well. Taken by Charles W Phillips.
